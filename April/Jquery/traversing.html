   <h1>Jquery Traversing</h1>
    <p>
       <h2>What is Traversing?</h2>
        <p>jQuery traversing, which means "move through", are used to "find" (or select) HTML elements based on their relation to other elements. Start with one selection and move through that selection until you reach the elements you desire.</p>
        <p>The image below illustrates an HTML page as a tree (DOM tree). With jQuery traversing, you can easily move up (ancestors), down (descendants) and sideways (siblings) in the tree, starting from the selected (current) element. This movement is called traversing - or moving through - the DOM tree.</p>
       <h2>Traversing Up the DOM Tree</h2>
            <p id="demo">Three useful jQuery methods for traversing up the DOM tree are:
                <ul>methods
                    <li>parent()</li>
                    <li>parents()</li>
                    <li>parentsUntil()</li>
                </ul></p>
                <p>The parent() method returns the direct parent element of the selected element.

                    This method only traverse a single level up the DOM tree.</p>
